# mobile_robot_tutorial
A simple ROS tutorial that explores publishers, subscribers, topics, launch files, and parameters.

The goal is to send power to the motors on several differential drive mobile robots to steer them around a course. Each robot will have different parameters that describe their wheel base, inertia, and diameter, and thus will require different commands to get them to do the same thing.

A set of complete and working code is contained in the folder `/sol`. However, the code in the `/src` folder is incomplete and will not run without modification.
